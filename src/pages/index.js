        Hey there! My name is Scott, and I'm your web developer.

      <Bio>
        I'm a recent graduate of the Front End
        Web Development bootcamp at Thinkful. I love how web development
        combines quantitative and qualitative problem solving skills, which
        is why I've chosen it as a career path. I'm excited by innovation,
        and always driven to find solutions that are efficient and artistic.
        <br /> <br />
        My curiosity has led me on adventures through several career fields
        including classical music performance, artistic administration, actuarial
        science, and now... coding! I feel most at home in front of my laptop, either
        learning a slick new library or designing the website for a business. At some
        point I drank the CrossFit kool-aid, so if my computer is off you can also find
        me in a local gym racking up some burpees!
